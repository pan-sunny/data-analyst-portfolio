# üìä Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio! This repository showcases a selection of projects that demonstrate my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, statistical modeling, and reproducible reporting using Python and R.

These projects include both real-world case studies from Kaggle and academic work from the Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization on Coursera.
